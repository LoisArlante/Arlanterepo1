#a a. Describe the Data
#The data includes three columns:
#Shoe size: Numeric values representing the shoe size of individuals.
#Height: Numeric values representing the height of individuals (in inches).
#Gender: A categorical variable that can either be "M" (Male) or "F" (Female).

#b. Create Subsets for Males and Females and Show R Code

# The Data
shoe_size <- c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 6.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 8.5, 7.5, 10.5, 12.0, 12.0)
